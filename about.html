    <!-- About Me -->
    <section id="about-me" class="feature">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        After graduating from the University of Iowa with degrees in English &amp; Creative Writing and Political Science (plus a minor in Philosophy, because why not?), I set out to travel on a budget. Thanks to the student loan pause, a remote job, and a lot of luck, I did some long-term traveling by volunteering through Workaway. Along the way, I stomped grapes (dodging wolf spiders), collected honey (tape your sleeves!), and mastered the fine art of getting a car unstuck from mud (this sometimes meant walking away for the night and returning the next day with reinforcements). I also relied on my knack for connection-building—like when I cat-sat for my friend’s friend’s aunt’s friend in the Upper West Side.
      </p>
      <p>
        These experiences taught me to take risks, embrace the kindness of strangers, and create opportunities through trust and resourcefulness. Whether navigating a bus strike in Germany with only a handful of German phrases, hand gestures, and some very patient strangers, or juggling multiple deadlines in the workplace, I know how to stay adaptable, build relationships, and get things done.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Deliver Strategies, I put these skills into practice during an unpredictable election cycle (Biden dropping out last minute? The Mark Robinson CNN article?). I crafted messaging for top-tier campaigns, conducted in-depth research, and delivered polished work on tight deadlines, all while staying focused on advancing progressive causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about using storytelling and strategy to drive meaningful change on issues like voting rights, racial justice, and climate action. If you want to talk politics, writing, or how to make connections in the most unexpected places, let’s connect!
