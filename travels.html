            help from her. Also so glad to have had thoughtful conversations on many
            topics. It is so good to have had an opportunity to meet so wonderful

            "Jackie is amazing, in so many ways... Where to begin... She's great
            in all the help she gives... her organizing talent is beyond!!! And
            she's so skilled in making order in things. I've felt so happy and 
            so blessed having her help. Jackie is very likable, because she's 
            friendly and straightforward in a pleasant way. And she has what we 
            in Denmark call a natural authority, the kind person where you always 
            listen to them, because they're so cool, clever and talented AND not 
            afraid to tell you what they are thinking (in a kind way). Jackie has 
            some really nice twists to things, meaning she sees things from many 
            perspectives, I loved listening to her. It's easy to hear she studied 
            philosophy. She's really hard working whatever she does."

            Jackie was so nice and friendly. She was honest and trustworthy. She
