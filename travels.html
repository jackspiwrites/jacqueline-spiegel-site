      <h2>Recent Travels</h2>
      <p>
        I've enjoyed traveling while self-employed, volunteering in new locations, learning about the local community, and making connections across the world. From a sustainable winery in Fort Davis, TX to a homestead in Norway to dogsitting in New Zealand, I've learned and grown through my travels. Below are some photos from my past travels!

            Jackie is a serious and capable worker, and in spite of her
            seriousness is a real joy to have around. I highly recommend her!

            Jaqueline went above and beyond the very hard work she did to
            interact with our daughter and provide helpful hints to help us reign
            in our exuberant pup. She was kind, respectful and overall a great
            person to be around. I regret at the time of her visit we did not
            have the full accommodations that we would have liked to offer, but
            she nonetheless adapted with grace.

            Jacky fitted seamlessly into our household. She was flexible and
            prepared to turn her hand to anything needed. She was great with our
            animals‚ÄîI‚Äôm sure they all miss her. Have a great time on your
            travels; may see you again one day in Liverpool xxx

            Jackie is a serious, reliable and responsible girl. She has been
            with us for a month and has really been a great help in managing our
            daily routine. Always ready to help and willing to meet our needs.
            She had just arrived and spent a whole Saturday (when she didn't have
            to work) helping us prepare and tidy up for our daughter's birthday
            party without us asking to. She is a very independent and quite
            reserved girl and it‚Äôs been a real pleasure hosting her!

            I had the luck to host Jackie for some weeks in May. It was awesome
            help from her, although diverse works with cleaning the apartments,
            she could be the best assistant for the renovation project of the
            house. Also so glad to have had thoughtful conversations on many
            topics. It is so good to have had an opportunity to host so wonderful
            a person like Jaqueline.

            Jackie is amazing, in so many ways... Where to begin... She's great
            in all the help she gives... I've wished to have a workawayer like
            her since the beginning, since her organizing talent is beyond!!! And
            she's so skilled in making order in things, I've never experienced
            anything like it... I've felt so happy and so blessed having her help
            me, I wish she could've stayed longer üòÅüòç I had way too many things
            and way too much mess in my things and she made it all look so neat
            and tidy, now everything has its really good place and I can find my
            way around where what is. ‚ù§Ô∏è She's also very good at helping me let
            go of a LOT of things. üòç We've had maybe 50 wonderful workawayers,
            but no one has ever come near this talent of Jackie's!!!! Jackie is
            very likable, bc she's friendly and straightforward in a pleasant
            way. And she has what we in Denmark call a natural authority, you
            know the kind person where you always listen to them, bc they're so
            cool, clever and talented AND not afraid to tell you what they are
            thinking (in a kind way). Jackie has some really nice twists to
            things, meaning she sees things from many perspectives, I loved
            listening to her. It's easy to hear she studied philosophy. She did a
            lot of great garden work, she planted plants, saved plants, watered
            plants, did some lawn mowing, pulled out a lot of weeds from the
            garden. She's really hard working whatever she does. She made a nice
            dinner for us one day, a really good Indian dish. And we had the
            pleasure of eating together now and then, always with nice
            interesting conversations. We also had some small trips here and
            there and it was always a pleasure to have Jackie along with us. I
            miss you already, Jacke. And you're always welcome back. I hope your
            dogs back home are doing well and likewise your family... üòç‚ù§Ô∏è

            Jackie was so nice and friendly. She was honest and trustworthy and
            is GREAT with dogs. She also makes a great chili! The best I have
            ever eaten. Thanks so much for coming. Badger loved all his walks
            with you. Good luck with your next chapter of life!
