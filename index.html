          <h2>Political Communications Writer</h2>
          <p>
            As the lead writer for my team working on independent direct-mail campaigns in the 2024 election cycle, I partnered with nonprofits to craft targeted, persuasive messages. I navigated tight deadlines, adapted quickly to different client voices, brand guidelines, and varied word counts, and collaborated closely with design teams to ensure cohesive, impactful final products.

          <h2>Essay Coach</h2>
          <p>
            I help students tackle their college application essays—especially the challenging Common App essay. I also volunteer with Fair Opportunity Project, providing free essay coaching for first-generation and underserved students.

      <h2>Workaway Volunteer</h2>
      <p>
        Through Workaway, I’ve volunteered in multiple countries, learning to bridge language and cultural barriers creatively—like when I communicated almost entirely through gestures with my Croatian host’s grandmother (earning a bowl of homemade sauerkraut). I learned new skills, from winemaking and honey harvesting to installing laminate flooring and practicing permaculture farming. These experiences have shown me firsthand how individuals shape communities and how communities shape the broader world.
