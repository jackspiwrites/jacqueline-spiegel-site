          <h2>Hi, I'm Jacqueline.</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a writer who loves figuring out how to communicate complex issues clearly and meaningfully—whether crafting persuasive political messaging, collaborating with nonprofits, or helping people find their stories. Whatever the project, my goal is always real connection.

          <p>
          I know how to craft messaging that moves people to action. I’m comfortable working fast, adapting to different voices and brands, and collaborating closely with teams, whether that's brainstorming with nonprofits or partnering with designers to fine-tune visuals. Whatever the project, my goal is always clear communication that makes an impact.
